* searching
** negamax
** iterative deepening
** alpha/beta
** Transition Tables
   usually preferred to refutation tables
** killer heuristic
    only a few moves will actually save your ass
** null move reductions
   if you just reduce ply instead of quitting, you're less likely to miss important things
** quiescence
*** delta pruning
    only make a capture if capture + margin of error (200 centipawns) can raise alpha
